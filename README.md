433 Mhz remote switch, battery powered.

The switch itself runs on an ATTINY85, programmed via Arduino IDE. The transmitter is a generic 433Mhz transmitter.
The receiver runs on a Raspberry Pi with a generic 433Mhz receiver and custom code (which you can find in RaspberryPi and rc-switch directories here).
